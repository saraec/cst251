		 <h2>Subject of the Lab</h2>
		 <p>The subject of this lab was to use CSS to style typography and other elements
			 to recreate another website.
			</p>

		 <h2>Summary and Difficulties</h2>
			<p>I partnered with Jasmine for this lab and she caught me up on what I missed in class.
				We picked a site to recreate and started it at home. We continued working on it together
				during class. I had a really hard time with the positioning. I couldnâ€™t get my main content
				centered vertically and horizontally. I also had trouble once getting them centered, they would
				overlap. I fixed this by playing with the percentages from the sides or top. I also had a difficult
				time with the navigation across the top. I started with an unordered list and was able to get it horizontal.
				I ran into trouble trying to center and space the items in the list. I chose to use a flexbox instead
				and chose one of the spacing options that it gave me. The last issue I had was I tried putting text
				decoration with a hover, but I could not get it to work.
				</p>

		 <h2>Results</h2>
				<p>My end result looks very similar to, butnot exactly like the original site. Some of my
					spacing and proximties are off. I think the colors I chose are accuarte as well as the
					fonts.
