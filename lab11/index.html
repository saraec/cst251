		 <h2>Subject of the Lab</h2>
		 <p>The main goal of this lab was to learn how to use block-level styling.
			</p>

		 <h2>Summary and Difficulties</h2>
			<p>I partnered with Jasmine, and we started working on the lab during class.
				This lab was more difficult than recent ones, but I was still able to gain
				an understanding of the tasks. The hardest aspect was positioning. This is
				somewhat of a new topic, so I'm not as familiar with the tags used.
				My sidebar landed in a few different spots of the screen before I used
				float: right to get it to stay aligned to the left. Getting the links
				to operate correctly was also difficult. I moved to aside to a couple different
				places inside the html until the position was right and the sticky feature worked.
				</p>

		 <h2>Results</h2>
				<p>I was able to use some new tags like aside, inline-block, position. I think using
					sticky make to page more interesting an dless static than the pages I've done
					before this one.
