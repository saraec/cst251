		 <h1>Lab 10: Styling Text Elements</h1>
	 <div id=text>
		 <h2>Subject of the Lab</h2>
		 <p>The main subjects goals of this lab are to use CSS to style text elements.
			 We must select a new font for our body text and modify the size, color, and
			 spacing of the headings.
			</p>

		 <h2>Summary and Difficulties</h2>
			<p>I had a pretty easy time with this lab. I partnered with Jasmine again for this lab, and we worked
				together during class. I used the html code from Lab 8 and the CSS file from Lab 9. I changed most
				of the attributes, so my page would look different from my previous ones. I imported a text,
				increased the spacing, and center aligned it. I added a background image and a semi transparent
				background behind my content. The only place I had trouble was my site CSS was interfering with my
				Lab 10 CSS. The orange background kept showing up on the page, and I didn't want it there. I looked
				at Wes's site and saw that they used "background-size: cover". I included that so the orange would
				be hidden by the image.
				</p>

		 <h2>Results</h2>
				<p>I am happy with my final page. I really like experimenting with the features that we have
					already learned. It feels affirming and gratifying to insert new skills and have them be successful on the page.
