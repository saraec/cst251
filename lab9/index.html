 <h2>Subject of the Lab</h2>
 <nav class=paragraph>
 <p>The subject of this lab is to use CSS to style my page as well as individual block elements.

 <h2>Summary and Difficulties</h2>
	<nav class=paragraph>
	  <p>I partnered with Jasmine for this lab. We had to work remotely and communicated over text.
			I recycled the code I have used in the preceeding labs. I changed almost all of the features
			in my CSS file. I increased the margins. I decreased the border size, padding, and letter spacing.
			I also wanted to try to apply an image to the background instead of floating in the corner. 
			I modified the font colors and imported a font from Google Fonts for my headings.
			I used id=main for my main content and class=paragraph for my larger areas of text that
			I could apply CSS to the individually.
