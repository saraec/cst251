			 <p  class="summary">Jasmine and I worked on the lab together after class on Wednesday. I linked the jquery, popper, and Bootstrap library in my CSS. Then I put the Bootstrap grid layout and nav bar into my html. Some of my content, like my headings and colors, were left over from the previous lab. I added a new font, new images, and new links. The only challenge I faced was trying to understand what and how elements defined in Bootstrap, so I could change the colors, size, etc. The only way I found to do this was to inspect elements in Chrome and copy and paste the CSS from there.

		<section><h2>Results</h2>
			 <p class="summary">This lab went a lot easier than the other labs because a majority of the CSS was provided by Bootstrap. I really liked using the grid layout because I struggled with creating a  responsive layout in the previous labs, and Bootstrap did all the hard work for me.</p></section>
