		<section><h2>Summary and Difficulties</h2>
			 <p  class="summary">I had a pretty easy time with this lab. I started with the sketches. A couple of the topics were ones from my teamâ€™s ideation time, and I made up a couple on my own. I just tried to find many different ways to utilize the same elements. The sketches went quickly. There was some time in between I spent thinking about what the next sketch would look like. For the code, I used some of my code from Lab 16 to create a base for this site. I modified the fonts, layout, and images so it fit with how I wanted this lab to look. I used a media query to try to make the site more responsive to smaller screen sizes. I like the way my final site ended up looking.

			 <p class="summary">This lab went well. Even though I didn't use many formating tags, I like the way the elements flow down the page. I also like the larger margins.</p></section>
