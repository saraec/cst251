		 <h2>Subject of the Lab</h2>
		 <p> The subject of the lab is to create an index page and style
			 with my own CSS style sheet.
			</p>

		 <h2>Summary and Difficulties</h2>
			<p> This lab was very straight forward. We have done all of the
				foundational aspects in previous labs. This lab was more about modifying
				the CSS file and understanding style sheets better. I added the lab 7 link to
				my homepage. I ran into a little difficulty when placing an image. I wasn't
				directing the link to the image folder. Once I realized that I was able to fix
				it easily. Within the CSS file I changed the background, font, and border colors.
				I also changed the size of the paddings and margins. I modified the image by increasing
				the saturation and changing the hue. I am still a bit confused about choosing the font family.
				I wanted to use a cool blackletter type font, but I wasn't able to figure it out.
				Does the font style have to be saved inside the file?
				</p>

		 <h2>Results</h2>
				<p> During this lab I was able to change the design and visuals of the page
					on my site. I looks very different from the preceding pages because I
					changed many of the properties within the CSS file. Now I have
					a better understanding of basic CSS.
