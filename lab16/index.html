		 <h2>Subject of the Lab</h2>
		 <p>The subject of this lab was to use new, "fancy" CSS I learned during lecture to style my website.
			</p>

		 <h2>Summary and Difficulties</h2>
				<p  class="summary">I partnered with Jasmine again for this lab. We worked together remotely because she was out of town. I started this lab by using basic HTML and CSS from my previous labs then I chose an image for the background. Initially, I wanted to do two spider webs so I could try two background images
				but when I did neither image would work. I couldn't figure out how to fix it, so I did a fixed background like we talked about during lecture. I put my summary text into columns. This went easily, and I like the way it looks. To that I added a hover that increased the line height and word spacing with a one second transition duration.
			  I put another hover and transition duration on the main title so the size would increase. The animation was where I struggled the most. I found a GIF I liked and wanted it to move across the page. I defined a div with multiple animation properties and a @keyframe tag with the positions I wanted the image to move to.
			  When I opened the site locally the image didn't move. </p>

		 <h2>Results</h2>
				<p>I think these new tags and elements we learned help to make the site a lot more dynamic and interesting. On this site in particular, I like the way the hover turned out on the columns. </p>
