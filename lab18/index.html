		 <p>The subject of this lab was to use the meta tag and media queries to make my site more responsive.
			</p>

		 <h2>Summary and Difficulties</h2>
				 <section><p  class="summary">For this lab I used some code from the flexbox.html file from Lab 17 to start. I changed the title, created a new aside (even though it looks the same), and added new pictures. I had some trouble getting the aside to be the right size and in the right place, but I think I got it to work. I made sure I used max-width a lot more in hopes my page will be more responsive now. For the media query I made it so that the colors of the screen invert when the screen width reaches 750px. This took me a while because of syntax errors and figuring out which div to apply it to. The things I struggled with the most were the nav bar and the links within the aside. The nav bar became transparent when I scrolled. I tried to fix this by moving it to the bottom of the code and increasing the z-index but it didn’t work. I also couldn’t get the thumbnail links to be centered in their div even with text-align: center. </p>

		 <h2>Results</h2>
				 <section><p>I am happy that I was able to get the new CSS to work, but I'm also a little frustrated that things we learned a while ago were difficult for me.</p>
