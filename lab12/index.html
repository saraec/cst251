		 <h1>Lab 12: Advanced Block-level Styling II</h1>

		 <h2>Subject of the Lab</h2>
		 <p>The subject of this lab is to practice using block-level styling and to incorporate
			 float and center align features.
		 </p>


		 <h2>Summary and Difficulties</h2>
			<p>Jasmine and I worked together on the lab starting with the basic layout
				and features that we have been using in class so far. This part of the lab was
				pretty simple. We started to struggle when we began on the CSS for the new features.
				The new boxes for each div were scattered all over the page. I also had trouble
				getting the images to fit inside the boxes. I looked at Wes's page for this lab and figured
				out what I was missing to make it work.
						</p>

		 <h2>Results</h2>
				<p>I think I was able to complete all of the new tasks that were assigned.
					It took some trial and error, but I was able to figure it out eventually.

			<div id="center-horz" class="center-div">
				<p>"The Moon displays these eight phases one after the other as it moves through its cycle each month.
					It takes 27 days for the Moon to orbit Earth. That means the Moon's cycle is 27 days long."</p>
