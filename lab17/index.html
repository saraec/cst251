			<h2>Summary</h2>
			<p>Jasmine and I worked on the lab together. I started mostly from scratch except for some of the CSS like colors and fonts that I used in previous labs. I created the different sections and put a border on them. I started with the flexbox file. One this one I had the most trouble with the aside. I created links within images and couldn’t get them to be the size I wanted. So everything is in the right place, but the images are way too small for the container they’re in. On the float file I had trouble positioning the nav. I put the nav in the header on the html, but when I opened it locally the links were always right underneath the header. I tried changing the position, display, size. Nothing I did worked. </p>

			<h2>Results</h2>
		  <p>I am not super happy with the outcome of this lab because I didn’t accomplish everything. There is an issue with an element on both pages which is dissatisfying. </p>
