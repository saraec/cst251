		<section><h2>Summary and Difficulties</h2>
			 <p  class="summary">This lab came together really quickly and easily. I got feedback from my teammates on my first round of sketches. They complimented my ideas: carousel, images in columns, and a background image for the header or under text. They suggested that side nav bars work better and that the designs with more images and less text worked better. There were a couple of sketches that I felt weren’t working or didn’t feel right, and they agreed. We also talked about other factors for the site as a whole. We agreed that there should be a recurring color and that one font should be used all the way through. I created three new sketches while incorporating things that worked with my first sketches and the suggestions that my team provided. I also tried to use more callouts that describe, more specifically, what will be on the site and what each element is.

		<section><h2>Results</h2>
			 <p class="summary">This lab was simple, but also neccessary. The feedback from my team was really useful in refining my designs. The second opinion helped me to realize what I liked and didn't like about the elements I had in my first round of sketches.</p></section>
