     <h2>Summary and Difficulties</h2>
		 		 <nav class=paragraph>
			<p> I partnered with Stephanie for this lab.
				We collaborated mainly through text to ask each other
				questions or to check our understanding of aspects of the lab.
				I had little difficulty with the lab itself. The html was recycled
				from my previous labs. I focused mainly on experimenting with the
				CSS and modifiying the visuals of the web page. The part that I
				struggled with the most was the image. When I tried to use a hover
				tag on the image, the photo moved from the top right to the left
				side under the title. I also wanted to move the image higher up on
				the page without increasing the size, but I couldn't figure it out.
				Additionaly, I think because I do not have a large amount of html that
				there weren't a lot of place where I could apply effects to one element
				but not the other. The only place I achieved this was in the font size and color.
				</p>

		 <h2>Results</h2>
		 <nav class=paragraph>
				<p> After completeing this lab I have a page that look very differently
					than my page from before. I changed the CSS for almost every element.
					So far I am really enjoying working with CSS because I like the design
					side of things.
