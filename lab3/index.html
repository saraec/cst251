 <h1>Lab 3: File Structure</h1>
	<div id=subject>
	 <h2>Subject of the Lab</h2>
		 <p>
			 The main subject of the lab is to increase my understanding of local file structure and how
			 to create new html files.
		 </p>

	 <h2>Difficulties</h2>
		 <p> This lab was fairly easy, partly because I completed one of the tasks last week as Task X.
			 Task 3 of the lab was slightly confusing because you are inserting an image of the file you're working
			 on back into the file. But once I figured out what the instructions were asking, it was pretty easy.

	 <h2>Results</h2>
			 <p> I created a basic site using html files that explains my experience working on lab 3.This lab was able to help me understand a slightly more complex version of what we have been doing.
				 I can already tell that it will be extremely important for me to keep my files and images really well organized.
