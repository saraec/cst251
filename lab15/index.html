		 <h2>Subject of the Lab</h2>
		 <p>The subject of this lab was to use new CSS elements to style a website.</p>

		 <h2>Summary and Difficulties</h2>
				<p>This lab was easy to understand. Jasmine and I partnered together, and we
					decided we would build our sites with the same colors and image. I used some
					of the code from my other lab to start with. I changed the content of it to
					match with this lab. I added many new elements to the CSS. I used object-fit,
					box-shadow, filter, and transform on the image. I rounded the corners on my nav
					bar and used a gradient as the background for my body. I also added text-shadows
					to my headings. The only issue I ran into was when I scrolled down my image
					would be on top of my nav bar. To fix this I put z-index: 100; on my nav div. </p>

		 <h2>Results</h2>
				<p>I think these new features will make my sites look more professional
				or cleaner, so I'm excited to keep practicing them.</p>
