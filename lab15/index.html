		 <h2>Subject of the Lab</h2>
		 <p>The subject of this lab was to use new CSS elements to style a website.</p>

		 <h2>Summary and Difficulties</h2>
				<p>Because I struggled with Lab 13, I chose to recreate another site that was easier
					than the one I did first. My Lab 13 had many errors, so for this one I wanted to get
					as close as I could to the original. I searched for the background image and fonts first.
					I had a really hard time finding the exact image and fonts, so I got as close as I could.
					Positioning the text went better for me during this lab, although it was pretty much the
					only thing I had issues with. I had a hard time getting the main title positioned vertically
					where I wanted it. After trying many different things to fix it, I noticed in the inspection
					tool there was a margin that wouldn’t allow the text to move up. I put margin: 0; on the
					container and it fixed the problem. The other issue I had was once I created the html for the
					actual lab, not the fake.html, it distorted the position of the text. The text was shortened
					horizontally which made it get taller. I didn’t know how to fix this issue.</p>

		 <h2>Results</h2>
				<p>My end result looks very similar to the original site. I think the background image is the
					only significant difference.</p>
