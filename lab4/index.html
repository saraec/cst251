	<h1>Lab 4: File Transfer</h1>
	 <div id=subject>
		<h2>Subject of the Lab</h2>
			<p>The subject of this lab is understanding file structures.
				Our goals are to test local files and upload them to the server.
			</p>
	 </div>
	 <div id=summary>
		<h2>Summary and Difficulties</h2>
			<p> This lab reflects a lot of the work that I have previously done in the other labs, mostly Lab 3.
				I was able to reuse the code and file structure from Lab 3 then change the specifics so that it fits to this lab.
				I worked with Jasmine on the lab for a short time during class.
			</p>
			<p> After realizing that I may have used a local image on a previous lab, I went back in and replaced it.
				I checked the other labs I've already completed to make sure that the images are correct and everything is working properly.
				Then I finished the remainder of the lab by adding more screenshots and explaining my results.
			</p>

	 <div id=results>
		<h2>Results</h2>
				<p> After finishing this lab I have an updated site on Github. I have a homepage and pages for labs 2, 3, and 4.
					They all have headings, paragraphs, and images. By repeating the process a couple of times I have become more familiar
					and comfortable with the file format and including images. I have also found better, more accurate ways of doing things
					compared to how I did them before.
