	<h1> Hello World </h1>
	<p> My name is Sara Christensen. I am from Hollister, CA. I enjoy participating in any kind of art.
	I really like to paint or even just observe paintings. I was recently given a film camera, so I have been trying my hand at that.
	I attend school at CSUMB and have class on campus three days a week: Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.
	The commute can be tiresome, but it is tolerable. I have recently been offered a job at the
	Student Disability Resources which I am excited to start. I will be working as a Deaf Services Assistant on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
	I have one sister who is a year older than me. She lives in Seaside and is also attending CSUMB. We are really close, and I try to spend as much time with her as I can.
	Whenever I have time between classes I go visit her and her dog, Fern. We usually go get coffee or a snack, maybe if we have time we'll go to the beach. As of late,
	that is pretty much what may day to day consists of.

	 <p> My partner's name is Jasmine. I met her when we exchanged numbers on the first day of class. She is softspoken, and she is knowledgeable and willing to help.
		 She is communicative and collaborates well with me. We have two of the same classes, so consequently we have a two hour break to work together inbetween. She has told me that she works a lot and sleeps a little
		 which seems like the worst combination. She has also said that her boyfriend is joining the army, so she writes to him everyday. I think that's very endearing. Jasmine is a lovely person, and I am happy to have her as my partner.
