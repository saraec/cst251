	<h1> Hello World </h1>
	<p> My name is Sara Christensen. I am from Hollister, CA. I enjoy participating in any kind of art.
	I really like to paint or even just observe paintings. I was recently given a film camera, so I have been trying my hand at that.
	I attend school at CSUMB and have class on campus three days a week: Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.
	The commute can be tiresome, but it is tolerable. I have recently been offered a job at the
	Student Disability Resources which I am excited to start. I will be working as a Deaf Services Assistant on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
	I have one sister who is a year older than me. She lives in Seaside and is also attending CSUMB. We are really close, and I try to spend as much time with her as I can.
	Whenever I have time between classes I go visit her and her dog, Fern. We usually go get coffee or a snack, maybe if we have time we'll go to the beach. As of late,
	that is pretty much what may day to day consists of.
