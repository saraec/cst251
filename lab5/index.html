	<h1>Lab 5: More HTML</h1>
	 <div id=subject>
		<h2>Subject of the Lab</h2>
			<p>The subject of this lab is to use the skills we've learned so far to create a site with text and images.
				We'll also use brand new skills to add links and linked images to the page.

		<h2>Summary and Difficulties</h2>
			<p>I started the lab by copying some of the code from other labs and pasting
				it into Lab 5. I noticed a mistake I had made in the other labs that instructions
				for this lab mentioned. I hadn't been customizing the title for the location bar
				when the site was open in a browser. So I went back to the other labs and fixed it.
				Then I placed two images and linked one of them to my website. I added another image and more text
				including a two links to other sites. I did face some difficulty when adding the link that returns
				the user to the homepage. I asked my partner if she knew how to fix it, but she didn't know.
				I went to Wes's homepage, inspected it, and was able to fix my mistake.

		<h2>Results</h2>
				<p>Completing this lab felt really rewarding. I was able to combine everything I've learned so far
					to create an effective website. The process went pretty seamlessly as well.

			 <p>These are a couple of design pieces that I made with Illustrator last summer. I am taking a Media Tools class,
				 and I've been learning new skills since I haven't used Photoshop much before.
				 I like to design things that reflect what I am interested in which is why I made a poster design for Phoebe Bridger's Punisher
			 album and a coffee shop that I like to go to called Vertigo. I linked my website that I have been modifying for my other class
		    that contains projects and assignments that I have been working on. </p>

			 <p>I recently watched a documentary about Shepard Fairley, the artist who founded <a href="https://obeygiant.com/" target="_new">OBEY</a>. He is somewhat controversial, and
				 his art is really political. But I really enjoyed the documentary and like the art he makes. I think it is really cool
				 that he was able to merge his to passions, skateboarding and design, and become a very successful artist.</p>
		   <p>Other artists I have been enjoying lately are Terry Urban and SLEW. I follow Terry Urban on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/terryurban/?hl=en" target="_new">Instagram</a> where he posts
			 his art and sometimes videos of him creating it. I really like that he uses many different mediums, and his process is interesting to watch.
		    I found SLEW through his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miNGgMZT9fs&t=0s" target="_new">youtube</a> channel, where he talks about his life as an artist and gives tips on how to become a better drawer and painter.</p>
