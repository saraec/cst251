		<p> Iâ€™m Sara Christensen, a design student who strives to make visually interesting and emotive art.
			I am currently a Communication Design student at CSU Monterey Bay with a concentration in visual design.
			Art has always been an outlet for me to express my interests, so now I want to pursue a career that is centered around inclusive, innovative design.
			Outside of school I love to do anything creative: painting, listening to music, and recently film photography
		 </p>
		 <p> In this class I am looking forward to learning about CSS and how to manipulate the outward appearance of a website.
			 I hope to use the information from this class to be more indepentdent with designing. Hvaing this knowledge will allow
			 me to create and design websites without help from a third party.
